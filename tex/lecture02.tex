Early Detection}
\begin{itemize}
    \item RED gateway drops packs with dynamically computed probability
    \begin{itemize}
        \item when average number of packets queued exceeds threshold $\texttt{min}_{\texttt{th}}$
        \item FCFS scheduling
        \item percentage dropped from $\texttt{connection}_i$ with input rate $\lambda_i$
        \[\frac{\lambda_i p}{\sum \lambda_i p} = \frac{\lambda}{\sum \lambda_i}\]
        \item output rate
        \[\frac{\lambda_i (1-p)}{\sum \lambda_i (1-p)} = \frac{\lambda}{\sum \lambda_i}\]
        \item RED drops packets in proportion to each connection's output usage
    \end{itemize}
    \item if congestion is persistent, average queue length is above $\texttt{min}_{\texttt{th}}$
    \begin{itemize}
        \item non-zero minimu drop probability regardless of bandwidth useage
    \end{itemize}
    \item unfair link sharing
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item bias against fragile connections
        \item accepting packet from one connection causes higher drop
        probability for future packets from other connections, even if they
        consume less bandwidth
        \item non-adaptive connection can force RED to drop packets at high rate
        from all connections
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Flow Random Early Drop (FRED)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item modified version of RED
        \item behaves like RED with $\texttt{min}_q$ and $\texttt{max}_q$ goals
        \begin{itemize}
            \item minimum and maximum number of packets each flow allowed to buffer
        \end{itemize}
        \item flows with fewer than \texttt{avgcq} packets queued are favored
        over flows with more
        \item maintains count of buffered packets \texttt{qlen} for each flow
        \item maintains variable strike for each flow
        \begin{itemize}
            \item counts the number of times flow has failed to respond to
            congestion notification
            \item penalizes flows with high strike values
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item simulations
    \begin{itemize}
        \item RED
        \begin{itemize}
            \item does not provide fair bandwidth sharing
        \end{itemize}
        \item FRED
        \begin{itemize}
            \item provides selective dropping based on per-active-flow buffer counts
            \item compatible with existing FIFO queueing architectures
            \item often fairer than RED when connections have different RTTs and
            window sizes
            \item protects adaptive flows from non-adaptive flows by enforcing
            dynamic per-flow queueing limits
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
