\begin{itemize}
    \item Design principles that help guide placement of functions among modules
    of distributed computer systems
    \item end-to-end argument
    \begin{itemize}
        \item suggests that functions placed at low levels are redundant or of
        little value compared to cost
        \item ``can only be completely and correctly immplemented with knowledge
        and help of application standing at end points of communication''
    \end{itemize}
    \item careful file transfer
    \begin{itemize}
        \item move file from $A$ to $B$ without damage
        \item can reinforce all steps by repetition
        \begin{itemize}
            \item may be uneconomical
        \end{itemize}
        \item alternate approach to ``check and retry''
        \begin{itemize}
            \item send checksum
            \item if failure probability low, will probably work on first try
        \end{itemize}
        \item in order to achieve, program must
        \begin{itemize}
            \item supply file-transfer specific, end-to-end reliability guarantee
            \begin{itemize}
                \item checksum to detect failures
                \item retry/commit plan
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        \item thus, even if data communication system is reliable, burder on
        application is not reduced
    \end{itemize}
    \item performance tradeoff
    \begin{itemize}
        \item if too unreliable, performance suffers because of frequent retries
        \item if internal reliability added, performance suffers because of
        redundant data (e.g. checksums)
        \item ``proper'' tradeoff requires careful thought
    \end{itemize}
    \item similar arguments for
    \begin{itemize}
        \item delivery guarantees
        \item secure transmission of data
        \item duplicate message suppression
        \item FIFO message delivery
        \item transaction management
    \end{itemize}
    \item must analyze the specific application requirements
    \item in the end, sort of an ``Occam's razor''
\end{itemize}
