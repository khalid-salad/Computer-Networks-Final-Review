Multicast}
\begin{itemize}
    \item New implementation of multicast called Free Riding Multicast (FRM)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item avoids need of distributed multicast route computation by
        leveraging unicast routes
        \item participation and use is effected via same channel as unicast, BGP
        (familiar framework)
    \end{itemize}
    \item moves cost from protocol to router internals
    \item areas that would benefit from multicast
    \begin{itemize}
        \item MMORPGs
        \item internet TV
        \item file-sharing, RSS, software updates, video conferencing, grids
    \end{itemize}
    \item application layer solutions less constrained by concerns of ISPs
    \begin{itemize}
        \item difficult to scale
    \end{itemize}
    \item network layer solutions scale by augmenting existing global ecosystem
    \begin{itemize}
        \item appealing for general-purpose services
    \end{itemize}
    \item Design
    \begin{itemize}
        \item group membership discovery
        \begin{itemize}
            \item group addresses encoded using bloom filter
            \begin{itemize}
                \item values are hashed, corresponding bits are set in filter
                \item membership checked by checking corresponding bits
                \item false positives but no false negatives
                \item can receive traffic not interested in
                \item either drop such traffic, or can inform upstream to stop
                forwarding such traffic 
            \end{itemize}
            \item false positive rate of $\min(1, \sfrac{f}{(A-G)})$, where $G$
            is number of groups, $A$ size of address space, and $f$ is number of
            allowed filters
            \item since false positive can only be triggered by one of $A - G$
            addresses
            \item adds memory requirement
            \begin{itemize}
                \item marginal in terms of cost
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        \item multicast packet forwarding
        \begin{itemize}
            \item forwarding at $R_s$
            \begin{itemize}
                \item 
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        \item Evaluation
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 
        \end{itemize}
